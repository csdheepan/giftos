# Angular 16 Firebase ShopEasy E-Commerce Web Application

## Project Overview:
This e-commerce web application is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. The application allows users to browse through a variety of products, add items to their cart, and place orders. The main focus of the project is on the frontend, leveraging Angular for building a dynamic and responsive user interface. Firebase is used for backend services, including authentication, database management, and hosting.

The application features a comprehensive user management system, including user registration, login, and two-step verification for enhanced security. The product catalog is dynamically populated, allowing users to search and filter products efficiently. The cart management system enables users to add, update, or remove items from their cart before proceeding to place an order.

While the current implementation does not include payment integration, it provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional features such as payment processing, order tracking, and user reviews.
